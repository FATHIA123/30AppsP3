# Issues/Future Improvements

Their a minor discrepancy in this application. In this application there is a bug that generates a visual glitch of the seconds hand everytime it the clock hits 0 seconds. It's caused by the fact that its transitioning from `440deg` all the way back to `0deg` and its transition-timing-function generates a huge 'overshot` effect. 

This issue can be fixed with an if loop, which is something I want to work on in the future.
